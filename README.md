## 🚀 Introduction
Our <span style="color:red">**WGFormer**</span> achieves <span style="color:red">**state-of-the-art**</span> performance in molecular ground-state conformation predictioin.
In particular, our WGFormer can be interpreted as Wasserstein gradient flows, which optimizes molecular conformation by minimizing a physically reasonable energy function defined on the latent mixture models of atoms, thereby significantly improving the model performance and interpretability.

## ⚒️ Environment
We have provided an `env.yml` file that contains the necessary environment dependencies. 
To set up your environment, please execute:
``` cmd
conda env create -f env.yml
conda activate WGFormer
```

## 📦 Datasets
We use the Molecule3D and QM9 provided in [GTMGC](https://github.com/Rich-XGK/GTMGC) as our datasets. Please download them and organize the `./data` directory as follows:
```
data
├── Molecule3D
│   ├── Random
│   │   ├── dict.txt
│   │   ├── random_train.csv
│   │   ├── random_train_0.sdf
│   │   ├── random_train_1.sdf
│   │   ├── random_train_2.sdf
│   │   ├── random_train_3.sdf
│   │   ├── random_valid.csv
│   │   ├── random_valid.sdf
│   │   ├── random_test.csv
│   │   └── random_test.sdf
│   ├── Scaffold
│   │   ├── dict.txt
│   │   ├── scaffold_train.csv
│   │   ├── scaffold_train_0.sdf
│   │   ├── scaffold_train_1.sdf
│   │   ├── scaffold_train_2.sdf
│   │   ├── scaffold_train_3.sdf
│   │   ├── scaffold_valid.csv
│   │   ├── scaffold_valid.sdf
│   │   ├── scaffold_test.csv
│   │   └── scaffold_test.sdf
├── QM9
│   ├── dict.txt
│   ├── gdb9.sdf
│   ├── train_indices.csv
│   ├── valid_indices.csv
│   └── test_indices.csv
```
Then, execute the command below to obtain the processed datasets:
``` cmd
cd data
python process_QM9.py
python process_Molecule3D.py
```
Here, the processed QM9 dataset has been provided in this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11WWuN_3hGKm7ZKltgUjlx4sKsHo9wP8A/view?usp=sharing).
